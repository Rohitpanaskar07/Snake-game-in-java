# Snake-game-in-java
This project contains the source code for a Snake game implemented in Java. The game features a classic Snake gameplay where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collision with the snake's own body or the game board's boundaries.

The game includes the following features:

Dynamically changing snake's length and speed based on the food consumption
Option to restart the game after the snake dies
Colorful and visually appealing graphics
Keyboard input for controlling the snake's movement
The project includes a Game class that handles the game logic and a Snake class that represents the snake and its behavior. The graphics are implemented using the Java Swing library.

Feel free to use and modify this code as you see fit. Enjoy playing the Snake game!
